## About Me

I'm a web developer based in Kabul, and I like to think of myself as the glue that holds everything together.

Being a developer is about more than just knowing how to write code; it's about understanding how all those lines of code fit together to create an experience for users. I love the challenge of taking a project from concept to completion and making sure that it's not only functional but also engaging and intuitive.

I have learned coding thanks to CodeWeekend and Scrimba since 2022, and I love being able to go in every day and learn something new about myself or my craft. I've learned so much since joining CodeWeekend, which is one reason why I'm so proud of what our cohort has accomplished.

I'm always looking for new projects to take on, so if you're looking for someone to help you out with your project—or even if you just want to talk about it—feel free to reach out!

Happy Coding!
